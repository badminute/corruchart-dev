# Corruchart (Corruption Chart)

Corruchart (v0.29.3) is a robust, fun, and interactive chart made for sexual beings of all kinds to discover, fill in, and share with others! Humans have long had a very large diversity of identities, sexual interests, preferences, and paraphilias. This chart intends to cover the plethora of everything under that umbrella and intends to evolve and expand with the suggestions of others via Feedback button on the final (results) page.

## Explanation and How to Use
This is an interactive, client-side-only chart that allows a user to indicate their levels (ranging from disgust to lust) of arousal (or lack thereof) of several interests. Just click the stars next to each label to cycle colours that represent these levels of arousal (or lack thereof). If you need to know more about what an interest is, just click the label to get a neat little description tooltip with a description carefully written and reviewed by me. There are other ways to use this tool that are shown in gif demonstrations that you can see by clicking the Tips button on each page.
